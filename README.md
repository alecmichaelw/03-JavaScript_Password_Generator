## Description

Using the knowledge I've attained so far, I successfully created a password generator using JavaScript. Web Dev Simplifiedâ€™s tutorial was a huge help, if not the main reason why I was successful. I also edited the CSS a bit to my liking; the grey background was easier on my eyes when coding at 4am.
